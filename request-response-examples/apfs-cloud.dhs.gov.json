Work includes structural wood beam and truss repairs, roof replacement, exterior stucco repairs, window and door replacement, correct indoor air quality problems, and interior finish updates.\r\n\r\nPERSONNEL AFFECTED: 30 full time and volunteer fire fighters.\r\n\r\nMISSION IMPACT: 1  The approximate response time from the nearest municipal or volunteer Fire Station is over 30- minutes, thus requiring TCP to staff a full-time Fire Department. The Fire Station supports fire prevention and response for TCP's 840-acres developed with 826,000 sqft of CG owned facilities valued at over $489M. TCP includes berthing for 450+ students and CG-owned family housing for 400+ active duty members and dependents. TCP is located in rural Sonoma County, approximately 8 miles from the city of Petaluma, an area with a consistently elevated risk of wildfires during the summer & fall months, as seen during the 2017 North Bay Area Wildfires.\r\n\r\nCONDITION: 1  The facility is in need of major repairs focusing on structural integrity and indoor air quality. The building was designed as open bay style berthing with 'Murphy' beds built into the main meeting\/ conference room prior to mixed gender integration within the Service. Berthing rooms were constructed during the 2001 addition; however, time has revealed many shortfalls of that addition's design. Specifically, the berthing rooms have no installed HVAC and are riddled with water infiltration through failing fa\u00e7ade and roof.  Additionally, the combined damage caused by termite infestation which was eradicated and water damage caused by failures in the building envelop will be more closely evaluated by a structural engineer.  \r\n\r\nSAFETY: 2  The lack of ventilation, water intrusion, and heavy daily use have led to poor indoor air quality, posing significant health and safety concerns..  Mold is a consistent problem.  Portable dehumidifiers and topical removal have been the only options thus far to remedy the mold.  The structure also suffered termite infestation which was remedied 2016 but this project will follow on to determine the extent of the structural damage and retrofit to comply with seismic codes. \r\n\r\nROI: 2  The Fire Department houses 10 fulltime civilian firefighters, 15 collateral duty auxiliary firefighters, and firefighting equipment valued at $1.5M. Over the past 15 years, TRACEN has spent over $1M in AFC 43 funds to make repairs to the structure. The facility remains occupied 24 hours a day 7 days a week for firefighting, training, and berthing. The indoor air quality, building envelop, and structural damage can be addressed with this maintenance project to allow the building to meet or exceed its expected lifespan and eliminate the impact to operations and quality of life for the occupants. Without this project, the building will not meet its expected lifespan and will require a sooner recapitalization of the asset (est $10M).","690":"PSN 18120509 \r\nReplace Floating Dock \r\nSTA Sturgeon Bay in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin","691":"13939643 Repair Galley Plumbing\r\nCG Station Erie\r\nErie, PA\r\n\r\nDemolish existing galley sink, below ground grease interceptor and sanitary drain branch along with existing building main sanitary drain that connects to the septic tank.
