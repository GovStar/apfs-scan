As the DHS lead for targeted violence and terrorism prevention, the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (“CP3”) helps communities prevent targeted violence and terrorism and build a safer America. To achieve that goal, CP3 develops partnerships across every level of government, the private sector, and in local communities across our country to provide funding, training, educational resources, and to increase awareness. The Student Innovation Lab is an experiential program that challenges high school and university students to create and implement peer-developed products, tools, and initiatives to prevent targeted violence, hate-fueled violence, and terrorism. The program allows essential prevention work to happen at the state and local level with the goal of reducing risk factors and increasing protective factors within youth populations. Through the Student Innovation Lab program, student teams design, implement, and measure the success of a social and digital product, tool, or initiative with a strong call to action to prevent targeted violence and terrorism. These projects are designed in a local context to ensure they are locally relevant, and teams leverage local partnerships to amplify their projects and ensure long-term sustainability and impact. \r\n\r\nThe program has been successful in inspiring and empowering youth to tackle some of the most critical challenges in the field of targeted violence and terrorism prevention. Since the inception of the program in the spring of 2021, more than 1,000 students have participated; 91 high school programs have been implemented across 25 states, and the labs have taken place in 32 states and the District of Columbia at 119 colleges and universities, including 10 HBCUs and 11 universities serving majority Black and brown populations.","contract_status":"REC","contractor":"Credence Management Solutions","contract_number":"70RDAD20FR0000178","estimated_period_of_performance_start":"03/30/2024","estimated_period_of_performance_end":"07/29/2024","anticipated_award_date":"03/28/2024","estimated_solicitation_release_date":"03/04/2024","place_of_performance_city":"Washington","place_of_performance_state":"DC","requirements_contact_first_name":"Samantha","requirements_contact_last_name":"Moss","requirements_contact_email":"samantha.moss@hq.dhs.gov","alternate_contact_first_name":"Jackita","alternate_contact_last_name":"Bass","alternate_contact_phone":"(404) 218-6762","alternate_contact_email":"jackita.bass@hq.dhs.gov","fiscal_year":2024,"created_on":"12/21/2023","requirements_office":"Office of Strategy, Planning, Analysis & Risk (SPAR) (70KSC6)","contracting_office":"Departmental Operations Acquisition Division (DOAD2) (70RDA2)","apfs_coordinator_office":"Acquisition Management and Support Division (AMSD)","current_state":"Published","last_updated_date":"01/16/2024","published_date":"01/16/2024","previous_published_date":null},{"id":65368,"mission":null,"organization":"DHS HQ/PLCY","small_business_program":"SB","dollar_range":{"display_name":"$2M to $5M","display_order":6},"contract_vehicle":"OASIS","competitive":"Follow-on to Existing Contract","award_quarter":"Q4 2024","estimated_release_date":"05/01/2024","publish_date":"02/08/2024","previous_publish_date":null,"requirements_contact_phone":"(202) 571-4660","naics":"541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services","apfs_number":"F2024065368","requirements_title":"Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3) Student Innovation Lab","requirement":"Contractor deliverables will revolve around supporting CP3’s student awareness program, as described below:\r\n\r\n•\tDesign and Implement Student Innovation Lab Program\r\n•\tCommunications and Marketing Plan Development\r\n•\tAdministrative Support, Meeting and Event Coordination\r\n•\tMeasuring Program Impact\r\n•\tProgram Management and Reporting\r\n\r\nDHS CP3 will sponsor a scholastic initiative centered on the establishment of semester-long or school year long innovation laboratories to drive innovation and the creation of targeted violence and terrorism prevention programs at the state and local level among a key cohort—youth and young adults.

This has gained lots of momentum in the federal financial space.  We want to automate other processes on our existing system as we continue to plan the FSM activities.  As we implement FSM, we would want to incorporate RPA.\r\n\r\nTo meet financial management requirements and optimize resources and results, the FEMA FSM PMO is coordinating with the DHS FSM Executive Steering Committee (ESC), the DHS-FEMA FSM Solution ESC, the DHS FSM Joint Program Management Office (JPMO), FEMA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO), and Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO) to modernize FEMA’s financial management environment.  The new environment will deliver functionality currently provided by FEMA’s legacy financial and mixed-use systems, including: the Web Integrated Financial Management Information System (WebIFMIS); Acquisition Package (ACCPAC); Enterprise Coordination and Approval Process System (eCAPS); Disaster Financial Support Capability (DFSC); the Payment and Reporting System (PARS); and the Procurement Request Information System Management (PRISM).  It is anticipated that the FSM program will replace these legacy systems with a modern financial system and improved business processes that satisfy FEMA’s mission needs and requirements and are consistent with DHS FSM JPMO requirements and the enterprise-wide Financial Management Systems Standard (FMSS) Business Process Taxonomy.\r\n\r\nThe FSM effort will provide an integrated finance, procurement and asset management system that enhances FEMA’s ability to accurately capture, aggregate, and report on financial, procurement and asset data.  The integrated financial system will interface to FEMA mission-related systems including but not limited to the Grants Management Modernization (GMM) FEMA Grants Outcomes (FEMA GO) system; the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Pivot system; and the Sunflower Asset Management System (SAMS).  The future Financial Management System (FMS) must allow for a sound financial, procurement and asset management baseline; enable enhanced support of DHS and FEMA strategic goals and mission needs; support future standardized, integrated and consolidated portfolio management capabilities; and achieve compliance with Federal and DHS standards and guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe FEMA FSM PMO is exploring methods to incrementally improve financial business processes through the use of emerging technology.  Automating high-volume routines and processes facilitates more predictable results, increases efficiency, and allows staff to focus attention on more complex tasks.  These incremental improvements also help to prepare stakeholders for larger modernization changes.\r\n\r\nDHS established the FSM JPMO with the goals of improving program management, governance, and oversight.  The DHS approach relies on strong involvement and representation from Components to help manage the programs, capture and apply lessons learned, and facilitate knowledge sharing.  The DHS FSM JPMO provides program management and leads the acquisition tasks and governance of all DHS FSM programs and projects.  The FEMA FSM PMO is a subordinate PMO to the JPMO and provides program management for FEMA FSM planning and pre-development activities.","contract_status":"REC","contractor":"Ka'ala Systems Technology","contract_number":"70FA3022C00000002","estimated_period_of_performance_start":"05/15/2024","estimated_period_of_performance_end":"05/14/2026","anticipated_award_date":"05/13/2024","estimated_solicitation_release_date":"02/02/2024","place_of_performance_city":"Washington","place_of_performance_state":"DC","requirements_contact_first_name":"Cornell","requirements_contact_last_name":"House","requirements_contact_email":"cornell.house@fema.dhs.gov","alternate_contact_first_name":"Michelle","alternate_contact_last_name":"Hicks","alternate_contact_phone":"(202) 288-2935","alternate_contact_email":"michelle.hicks@fema.dhs.gov","fiscal_year":2024,"created_on":"01/02/2024","requirements_office":"OCFO","contracting_office":"OCPO - IT Support Branch","apfs_coordinator_office":"Small Business Coordinator","current_state":"Published","last_updated_date":"03/04/2024","published_date":"03/04/2024","previous_published_date":"01/05/2024"},{"id":63864,"mission":null,"organization":"FEMA","small_business_program":"SB","dollar_range":{"display_name":"$2M to $5M","display_order":6},"contract_vehicle":"NITAAC CIO-SP3","competitive":"New Requirement, No Contract","award_quarter":"Q2 2024","estimated_release_date":"12/28/2023","publish_date":"12/20/2023","previous_publish_date":null,"requirements_contact_phone":"(202) 718-3337","naics":"541512 - Computer Systems Design Services","apfs_number":"F2023063864","requirements_title":"FEMA Incident Workforce Academy (FIWA), Curriculum Delivery Module (CDM) Staff Support","requirement":"The scope of this contract is to provide IT technical support services to the FEMA Incident Workforce Academy (FIWA) for the Curriculum Delivery Module (CDM).

An “emerging threat” is defined as one that may be newly recognized; may have been recognized before, but with new or different impacts; or may be an existing threat that has developed new attributes that pose a challenge to existing FEMA and mission partner core capabilities to respond and to recover from such threats and hazards. Examples include cyber-attacks, resurgent nation-state threats, and climate change, among others. Addressing such threats requires close linkages between intelligence, data analytics, and assessed risk to drive FEMA and mission partner response and recovery capability development, planning, and operations. The vision of OET is to help FEMA and its mission partners understand and address a wide array of novel emerging threats. OET represents the “bridge” needed to fill the gap between emerging threats identified by the Intelligence Community (IC) or other information sources, and the risk-informed development, management, and delivery of FEMA and mission partner operational capabilities. The mission of OET is to identify, assess, and inform FEMA and its mission partners of emerging threats that may significantly challenge the Nation’s core capabilities for incident response and recovery. The contractor would support the following: (a) support the OET mission functions: emerging threat identification & risk analysis; risk management; and response & recovery support branch activities; (b) support and as directed, conduct strategic communications on OET-related initiatives and its mission with designated FEMA and its Federal partners; (c) support other FEMA divisions and programs in providing technical staff support and/or SME focused on CBRN and non-CBRN emerging threats during steady-state or as directed, response postures. For performing emerging threat identification and risk analysis, the contractor will need designated staff to possess a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI), while other staff supporting the other two mission functions may achieve Public Trust level clearance.  The contractor in executing the general tasks described shall provide specific products and services in the following forms: (a) policies and plans research and development to develop (or enhance existing) risk analysis reports on a minimum of a frequent basis (e.g., bi-weekly or as directed) to inform OET and FEMA senior leadership on potential emerging threats and their impacts to FEMA and its Federal mission partners' response and recovery core capabilities; (b) (b)\tDevelop or enhance existing planning guidance, operational support tools (e.g., job aids), and/or best practice documents to address CBRN and non-CBRN emerging threats; (c) (c)\tPrepare specific briefs, read-ahead documents, and External Affairs-related documents to effectively communicate OET program products, deliverables and/or initiatives (to include training materials).","contract_status":"REC","contractor":"Gryphon Scientific, LLC","contract_number":"70FA5019D00000001","estimated_period_of_performance_start":"05/01/2024","estimated_period_of_performance_end":"04/30/2029","anticipated_award_date":"05/01/2024","estimated_solicitation_release_date":"02/01/2024","place_of_performance_city":"Washington","place_of_performance_state":"DC","requirements_contact_first_name":"Tara","requirements_contact_last_name":"Shirley","requirements_contact_email":"tara.shirley@fema.dhs.gov","alternate_contact_first_name":"Kerrisha","alternate_contact_last_name":"Francis","alternate_contact_phone":"(985) 215-9106","alternate_contact_email":"kerrisha.francis@fema.dhs.gov","fiscal_year":2024,"created_on":"11/18/2023","requirements_office":"ORR - RES","contracting_office":"OCPO - Continuity Branch","apfs_coordinator_office":"Small Business Coordinator","current_state":"Published","last_updated_date":"12/11/2023","published_date":"12/11/2023","previous_published_date":null},{"id":61101,"mission":null,"organization":"FEMA","small_business_program":"None","dollar_range":{"display_name":"Over $100M","display_order":11},"contract_vehicle":"Indefinite Delivery Contract","competitive":"New Requirement, No Contract","award_quarter":"Q3 2024","estimated_release_date":"03/25/2024","publish_date":"03/04/2024","previous_publish_date":"12/04/2023","requirements_contact_phone":"(202) 655-0721","naics":"541614 - Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services","apfs_number":"*F2023061101","requirements_title":"Logistics Planning and Construction Services Contract","requirement":"The Transportable Temporary Housing Unit  (TTHU) program, is seeking assistance with disaster housing planning, quality control, technical analyses, and administrative services to support direct temporary housing implementation.

Ongoing investigations have found that access to corporate records is critical in efforts to build cases against these TOC groups. These corporate records are generally publicly available but collecting the records on a case-by-case basis is time and cost prohibitive. Fortunately, commercial data aggregators have assembled large quantities of these records and make them available for procurement.\r\n•\tBulk global shipping records are critical as often TOC groups procuring fentanyl precursors ship these precursors through channels which do not enter the United States and therefore are not in\r\nU.S. Shipping records. Additionally, TOC groups often utilize non-traditional shipping routes to obscure the origin and destination of shipments. Data aggregators have assembled large quantities of these records with a near global scope. Ongoing investigations have demonstrated obtaining access to this data is critical to illuminating the illicit networks.\tData Platform. This Data Platform shall provide a holistic view of company information and shipping records in a cloud-based data processing environment that offers the full spectrum of data ingestion, processing, and augmentation tools, which provides the capability to perform risk assessments, anomaly detection, change detection and alerting, and large-scale graph analytics.\r\n\r\nScope: ICE requires access to conformed corporate and shipping records. No single source of these data sets will provide HSI with the level of detailed needed to fulfil its requirement. As a result, HSI requires a solution that will likely require a combination of information from multiple data aggregators. If this solution is presented the offeror must provide a combined dataset with a single data schema. Given the time criticality of obtaining these records the Government will not support a solution which proposes to build this data consolidation after award or award to an offeror who does not have an existing demonstratable solution.","contract_status":"REC","contractor":"Thundercat Technology LLC","contract_number":"70CMSD23FR00000017","estimated_period_of_performance_start":"03/20/2024","estimated_period_of_performance_end":"03/19/2029","anticipated_award_date":"03/19/2024","estimated_solicitation_release_date":"02/20/2024","place_of_performance_city":"Arlington","place_of_performance_state":"VA","requirements_contact_first_name":"Michelle","requirements_contact_last_name":"Levine","requirements_contact_email":"michelle.levine@ice.dhs.gov","alternate_contact_first_name":"Michael","alternate_contact_last_name":"Royer","alternate_contact_phone":"(202) 913-5088","alternate_contact_email":"michael.a.royer@ice.dhs.gov","fiscal_year":2024,"created_on":"01/30/2024","requirements_office":"HQ-D6","contracting_office":"IOSD-Investigation and Ops Support","apfs_coordinator_office":"APFS Coordinator","current_state":"Published","last_updated_date":"01/30/2024","published_date":"01/30/2024","previous_published_date":null},{"id":63493,"mission":null,"organization":"ICE/HSI","small_business_program":"SB","dollar_range":{"display_name":"$10M to $20M","display_order":8},"contract_vehicle":"OASIS","competitive":"New Requirement, No Contract","award_quarter":"Q4 2024","estimated_release_date":"05/31/2024","publish_date":"09/08/2023","previous_publish_date":null,"requirements_contact_phone":"(202) 487-5456","naics":"541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services","apfs_number":"F2023063493","requirements_title":"VISA SECURITY PROGRAM & INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUPPORT SERVICES","requirement":"The scope for this effort requires the Contractor to provide support for technical services across multiple technical and non-technical disciplines.

Due to this need, the DHS is pursuing the third generation of its Strategic Sourcing Vehicle (SSV) for Professional Services. The intent of this SSV is to provide a superior, consistent, and standardized solution to common PM&A requirements with a suite of basic services such as; consulting, clerical, personnel, physical distribution, billing, reporting, operations, financial planning, stenotype, and record keeping.\r\nThe Program Management, Administrative, Clerical, and Technical Services (PACTS) I and II were set-aside 100% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) which enabled the DHS to surpass its SDVOSB goals since Fiscal Year 2009. DHS will continue to support and access SDVOSB businesses through PACTS III and will also expand this third generation of PACTS to include other federal set-aside programs.\r\n\r\nDHS has conducted extensive market research to shape the strategy for the next generation of PACTS to ensure it can support the requirements of our Components and Headquarters customers. Through this analysis, DHS has determined that it is in the best interest of the Department and industry for this next generation of PACTS to include separate and distinct tracks for service-disabled veteran-owned, women-owned, HUBZone, and 8(a) businesses. This adjustment will enable DHS to expand opportunities to small businesses, assist the Department with continuing to achieve and exceed its small business and socioeconomic goals and reduce unmanaged spend.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, DHS is considering the following NAICS codes for this SSV: 561110 Office Administrative Services; 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services; and 541330 Engineering Services.\r\n\r\nThe Department will be hosting an Industry Day in the March timeframe and will post more information on additional opportunities to engage on PACTS III in the coming month.\r\n\r\nThis procurement is in the market research phase and the requirements may change over time.  This message will be updated accordingly.","contract_status":"REC","contractor":"PACTS II Primes","contract_number":"Many","estimated_period_of_performance_start":"02/28/2025","estimated_period_of_performance_end":"10/07/2039","anticipated_award_date":"10/07/2024","estimated_solicitation_release_date":"02/05/2024","place_of_performance_city":"Multiple","place_of_performance_state":"NA","requirements_contact_first_name":"Office of Contracting","requirements_contact_last_name":"USCIS","requirements_contact_email":"pactsiii@uscis.dhs.gov","alternate_contact_first_name":"","alternate_contact_last_name":"","alternate_contact_phone":"","alternate_contact_email":"","fiscal_year":2025,"created_on":"08/17/2022","requirements_office":"MGMT/OCON","contracting_office":"MGMT/Contracting/Operations","apfs_coordinator_office":"MGMT/CON","current_state":"Published","last_updated_date":"02/06/2024","published_date":"02/06/2024","previous_published_date":"01/17/2024"},{"id":64697,"mission":null,"organization":"USCIS","small_business_program":"SB","dollar_range":{"display_name":"$500K to $1M","display_order":4},"contract_vehicle":"Definitive Contract","competitive":"New Requirement, No Contract","award_quarter":"Q3 2024","estimated_release_date":"03/08/2024","publish_date":"03/04/2024","previous_publish_date":"01/31/2024","requirements_contact_phone":"(704) 579-2042","naics":"561510 - Travel Agencies","apfs_number":"*F2024064697","requirements_title":"Travel Visa Support Services","requirement":"Revised 01/30/24:  Update estimated solicitation release and award dates.\r\n\r\nUSCIS Refugee, Asylum, International Operations, International Travel Office (RAIO-ITO) (Camp Springs, Maryland & Washington, DC) is currently seeking to acquire Travel Visa Support Services to support official and diplomatic travel requests in service of the USCIS mission and operations.

Work includes structural wood beam and truss repairs, roof replacement, exterior stucco repairs, window and door replacement, correct indoor air quality problems, and interior finish updates.\r\n\r\nPERSONNEL AFFECTED: 30 full time and volunteer fire fighters.\r\n\r\nMISSION IMPACT: 1  The approximate response time from the nearest municipal or volunteer Fire Station is over 30- minutes, thus requiring TCP to staff a full-time Fire Department. The Fire Station supports fire prevention and response for TCP's 840-acres developed with 826,000 sqft of CG owned facilities valued at over $489M. TCP includes berthing for 450+ students and CG-owned family housing for 400+ active duty members and dependents. TCP is located in rural Sonoma County, approximately 8 miles from the city of Petaluma, an area with a consistently elevated risk of wildfires during the summer & fall months, as seen during the 2017 North Bay Area Wildfires.\r\n\r\nCONDITION: 1  The facility is in need of major repairs focusing on structural integrity and indoor air quality. The building was designed as open bay style berthing with 'Murphy' beds built into the main meeting/ conference room prior to mixed gender integration within the Service. Berthing rooms were constructed during the 2001 addition; however, time has revealed many shortfalls of that addition's design. Specifically, the berthing rooms have no installed HVAC and are riddled with water infiltration through failing façade and roof.  Additionally, the combined damage caused by termite infestation which was eradicated and water damage caused by failures in the building envelop will be more closely evaluated by a structural engineer.  \r\n\r\nSAFETY: 2  The lack of ventilation, water intrusion, and heavy daily use have led to poor indoor air quality, posing significant health and safety concerns..  Mold is a consistent problem.  Portable dehumidifiers and topical removal have been the only options thus far to remedy the mold.  The structure also suffered termite infestation which was remedied 2016 but this project will follow on to determine the extent of the structural damage and retrofit to comply with seismic codes. \r\n\r\nROI: 2  The Fire Department houses 10 fulltime civilian firefighters, 15 collateral duty auxiliary firefighters, and firefighting equipment valued at $1.5M. Over the past 15 years, TRACEN has spent over $1M in AFC 43 funds to make repairs to the structure. The facility remains occupied 24 hours a day 7 days a week for firefighting, training, and berthing. The indoor air quality, building envelop, and structural damage can be addressed with this maintenance project to allow the building to meet or exceed its expected lifespan and eliminate the impact to operations and quality of life for the occupants. Without this project, the building will not meet its expected lifespan and will require a sooner recapitalization of the asset (est $10M).","contract_status":"NEW","contractor":null,"contract_number":null,"estimated_period_of_performance_start":"04/01/2024","estimated_period_of_performance_end":"06/03/2024","anticipated_award_date":"04/01/2024","estimated_solicitation_release_date":"02/26/2024","place_of_performance_city":"Petaluma","place_of_performance_state":"CA","requirements_contact_first_name":"Mariya","requirements_contact_last_name":"Wilbur","requirements_contact_email":"mariya.n.wilbur@uscg.mil","alternate_contact_first_name":"Tony","alternate_contact_last_name":"Vanwinden","alternate_contact_phone":"(707) 765-7655","alternate_contact_email":"tony.p.vanwinden@uscg.mil","fiscal_year":2024,"created_on":"08/31/2023","requirements_office":"USCG Training Center Petaluma (Requirements)","contracting_office":"CEU Oakland (Contracting)","apfs_coordinator_office":"CEU Seattle-(APFS Coordinator)","current_state":"Published","last_updated_date":"08/31/2023","published_date":"08/31/2023","previous_published_date":null},{"id":65115,"mission":null,"organization":"USCG/SILC-Const.","small_business_program":"8(a)","dollar_range":{"display_name":"$250K to $500K","display_order":3},"contract_vehicle":"IDIQ TO/DO (Non Strategic Sourcing Vehicle Multiple Award Contract)","competitive":"New Requirement, No Contract","award_quarter":"Q3 2024","estimated_release_date":"03/01/2024","publish_date":"01/30/2024","previous_publish_date":null,"requirements_contact_phone":"(206) 820-0828","naics":"236210 - Industrial Building Construction","apfs_number":"F2024065115","requirements_title":"18120509 Replace Floating Dock STA Sturgeon Bay","requirement":"PSN 18120509 \r\nReplace Floating Dock \r\nSTA Sturgeon Bay in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin","contract_status":"NEW","contractor":null,"contract_number":null,"estimated_period_of_performance_start":"04/01/2024","estimated_period_of_performance_end":"01/20/2025","anticipated_award_date":"04/01/2024","estimated_solicitation_release_date":"03/01/2024","place_of_performance_city":"Sturgeon Bay","place_of_performance_state":"WI","requirements_contact_first_name":"Amanda","requirements_contact_last_name":"Jordan","requirements_contact_email":"amanda.g.jordan@uscg.mil","alternate_contact_first_name":"","alternate_contact_last_name":"","alternate_contact_phone":"","alternate_contact_email":"","fiscal_year":2024,"created_on":"01/10/2024","requirements_office":"CEU Cleveland (Requirements)","contracting_office":"CEU Cleveland (Contracting)","apfs_coordinator_office":"FDCC DET Seattle (APFS Coordinator)","current_state":"Published","last_updated_date":"01/30/2024","published_date":"01/30/2024","previous_published_date":null},{"id":65239,"mission":null,"organization":"USCG/SILC-Const.","small_business_program":"SDVOSB","dollar_range":{"display_name":"$250K to $500K","display_order":3},"contract_vehicle":"IDIQ TO/DO (Non Strategic Sourcing Vehicle Multiple Award Contract)","competitive":"New Requirement, No Contract","award_quarter":"Q3 2024","estimated_release_date":"03/01/2024","publish_date":"01/30/2024","previous_publish_date":null,"requirements_contact_phone":"(206) 820-0828","naics":"236210 - Industrial Building Construction","apfs_number":"F2024065239","requirements_title":"13939643 Repair Galley Plumbing at STA Erie","requirement":"13939643 Repair Galley Plumbing\r\nCG Station Erie\r\nErie, PA\r\n\r\nDemolish existing galley sink, below ground grease interceptor and sanitary drain branch along with existing building main sanitary drain that connects to the septic tank.

For FY20 we experienced one water line rupture every 2-3 months. Each break resulted in securing water to various buildings, sometimes for up to two weeks, impacting those buildings missions. \r\nCondition: (2) The oldest sections are from the 1930’s. These sections are experiencing frequent breakages and there are an unknown number of pinhole leaks that are yet to be discovered because they just permeate to the bay.\r\nSafety: (1) The ruptures to the system have the potential to allow migration of contaminants into the drinking water system for the Base.   \r\nROI: (1) In several of the ruptures, there is evidence that the leak had been left undiscovered below asphalt for many months prior to getting large enough to break through the pavement at which time it was discovered. The loss of water due to undiscovered pinhole leaks is unknown but is likely significant. Replacing these aging sections will result in water savings and multiple costly repair projects performed by Base as each leak is discovered. \r\nEnvironmental: (1) With each rupture there is a loss of sediment to the SF Bay either directly or through storm water system. \r\nThis project has phasing potential but recommend to complete as one project to realize economies of scale.\r\n\r\nPSN 18362575: CPOP FY23 Approved\r\nPSN 15246290 and 15246290 RPOP","contract_status":"NEW","contractor":null,"contract_number":null,"estimated_period_of_performance_start":"03/15/2024","estimated_period_of_performance_end":"05/15/2024","anticipated_award_date":"03/15/2024","estimated_solicitation_release_date":"02/09/2024","place_of_performance_city":"Alameda","place_of_performance_state":"CA","requirements_contact_first_name":"Tony","requirements_contact_last_name":"Flores","requirements_contact_email":"tony.l.flores@uscg.mil","alternate_contact_first_name":"","alternate_contact_last_name":"","alternate_contact_phone":"","alternate_contact_email":"","fiscal_year":2024,"created_on":"08/24/2023","requirements_office":"CEU OAKLAND OPFAC (51290) (Requirements)","contracting_office":"CEU Oakland (Contracting)","apfs_coordinator_office":"FDCC DET Seattle (APFS Coordinator)","current_state":"Published","last_updated_date":"08/31/2023","published_date":"08/31/2023","previous_published_date":null},{"id":63943,"mission":null,"organization":"USCG/SILC-Const.","small_business_program":"SDVOSB","dollar_range":{"display_name":"$2M to $5M","display_order":6},"contract_vehicle":"Design/Build Construction Services II (Regional) (RMACC II)","competitive":"New Requirement, No Contract","award_quarter":"Q2 2024","estimated_release_date":"02/09/2024","publish_date":"08/31/2023","previous_publish_date":null,"requirements_contact_phone":"(510) 637-5585","naics":"237990 - Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction","apfs_number":"F2023063943","requirements_title":"19294762 FY24 C-POP Major M&R to Exterior at Marina Village Housing Phase 1/4","requirement":"Exterior Maintenance and Repairs at Marina Village Housing\r\n\r\nPSN 19294762 Major M&R Exterior at Marina Village Housing Phase 1: C-POP FY24 APPR for $2.4M (IGE $3M) – Repair 75 homes with balcony membrane water damage and siding\r\n\r\nPSN 21995183 Major M&R Exterior at Marina Village Housing Phase 2: C-POP FY25 WAPPR IGE $3M – Repair 75 homes with balcony membrane water damage and siding\r\n\r\nPSN 21995361 Major M&R Exterior at Marina Village Housing Phase 3: C-POP FY26 WAPPR IGE $1.5M – Repair 75 homes siding\r\n\r\nPSN 21995362 Major M&R Exterior at Marina Village Housing Phase 4: C-POP FY27 WAPPR IGE $1.5M – Repair 75 homes siding","contract_status":"NEW","contractor":null,"contract_number":null,"estimated_period_of_performance_start":"03/15/2024","estimated_period_of_performance_end":"05/15/2024","anticipated_award_date":"03/15/2024","estimated_solicitation_release_date":"02/09/2024","place_of_performance_city":"Alameda","place_of_performance_state":"CA","requirements_contact_first_name":"Tony","requirements_contact_last_name":"Flores","requirements_contact_email":"tony.l.flores@uscg.mil","alternate_contact_first_name":"","alternate_contact_last_name":"","alternate_contact_phone":"","alternate_contact_email":"","fiscal_year":2024,"created_on":"08/24/2023","requirements_office":"CEU OAKLAND OPFAC (51290) (Requirements)","contracting_office":"CEU Oakland (Contracting)","apfs_coordinator_office":"CEU Seattle-(APFS Coordinator)","current_state":"Published","last_updated_date":"08/31/2023","published_date":"08/31/2023","previous_published_date":null},{"id":63945,"mission":null,"organization":"USCG/SILC-Const.","small_business_program":"SDVOSB","dollar_range":{"display_name":"$500K to $1M","display_order":4},"contract_vehicle":"Design/Build Construction Services II (Regional) (RMACC II)","competitive":"New Requirement, No Contract","award_quarter":"Q3 2024","estimated_release_date":"02/26/2024","publish_date":"08/31/2023","previous_publish_date":null,"requirements_contact_phone":"(510) 637-5585","naics":"237990 - Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction","apfs_number":"F2023063945","requirements_title":"18866153 Replace ATON in San Francisco AOR (Oakland Harbor)","requirement":"Scope: This project will replace or repair eight major aids to navigation in the ANT San Francisco AOR.

Complex organizational problems that require a change in human behavior cannot be solved with the stroke of a pen, a leadership mandate, a training program, restructuring, or changing a system. While these things can be helpful, all grand strategies must, eventually, degenerate down to real work done by real people. Understanding that trust drives those critical areas of change in human behavior and employees’ performance, ICE leadership authorized OLCD to develop a leadership course that focus on trust and team performance. To fulfill the unprecedented growth in ICE and the expansion of the ICE mission, this course needs to be agile, collaborative, innovative, and engaged team building.\r\nThe two (2) days training program will focus on the case of trust, from self-trust, relationship trust, organizational trust, market trust, to societal trust.
